Generating SHCM for MSRC Data-set

Developed by Rohanj and Mridulv

> Currently there are different matlab files for different classes.
> File shcm1.m will generate SHCM for class 1 and so on.
> Each file requires texton-map.mat file to be present in the current folder, which is the coordinates of 
various textons computed earlier.
> When you run each file it will generate resultsforclass[i].mat where i is the class i.
resultsforclass1.mat will be generated for class 1
