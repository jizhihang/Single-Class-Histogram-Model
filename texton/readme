Readme file for texton-map

Developed by Rohanj and Mridulv @ IIT Kanpur

To generate texton-map for some set of files use imagew.m
	> Adjust the database source path accordingly
	> Adjust the value of k by your requirement. By default it is 400.
	> The texton maps of images in src folder will be saved as .jpg files in current folder
	> tq is the matrix storing coordinates of the k cluster centers. Its size depends on k and window size.

To embed the code into RF_segment code:-
	> copy the folder as it is in the folder "default"
	> the file do_lpd.m will call functions computeclusters and computeTextonMap
	> use the code for SHCM to generate SHCM for each class
